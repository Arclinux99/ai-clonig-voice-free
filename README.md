# AI Cloning Voice Free
Free voice cloning using Colab.

üëâ [Directly Open F5-TTS on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NeuralFalconYT/F5-TTS-Demo/blob/main/F5_TTS_Latest.ipynb)



## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your free AI voice cloning:

1. **Open Colab** and run the following commands:

    ```bash
    # Check CUDA version
    !nvcc --version

    # Install PyTorch
    pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
    ```

2. **Install F5-TTS**:

    ```bash
    !pip install git+https://github.com/SWivid/F5-TTS.git
    from IPython.display import clear_output
    clear_output()
    ```

3. **Run F5-TTS with Gradio**:

    ```bash
    !f5-tts_infer-gradio --share
    ```
4. **Click the publick url**

Congratulations! You now have a lifetime of free AI voice cloning.

For eazy way, check out this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbkVLLU1HbzVCUzdkeEZBVVB5ZE1ObTc4NC15QXxBQ3Jtc0ttVEFNT0tQTHpnc2xkVmNNd2lLam41eGpBYlBycUNGRWRpVDNiS1pWZENZSm82ODZEZDdiOUR1TUIxR1ZSTG5KWURDX19tMGZzZ3NrTHMxa1A4UWVvUHlIUTI0N1RyQlRaMGR0cldWRE5BdTNlaExRQQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fcolab.research.google.com%2Fgithub%2FNeuralFalconYT%2FF5-TTS-Demo%2Fblob%2Fmain%2FF5_TTS_Latest.ipynb&v=VwWjg5FKah8).

5. **Click inspect, go to console**
üí° Copy and Paste (JavaScript):
```bash
function KeepColabAlive() {  
    setInterval(function() { console.log("Keeping Colab alive..."); }, 30000);  
}  
KeepColabAlive();
 ```
#‚ö†Ô∏è If you get a warning while pasting the code in the console, just type:
allow pasting and press Enter, then paste the JavaScript code again!
#‚ö†Ô∏è This method works for inactivity timeouts but only up to 12 hours because it's a free version of Colab. If you need longer runtimes:

 ```bash

   
Paraphrase and Expand:

Rewrite the script in your own words while maintaining the original message. This will ensure that the content is unique, yet stays true to the core ideas.

Add extra details, examples, or personal anecdotes to expand on the original points. This could include relevant stories, analogies, or expanded explanations of key concepts. For example, if the script discusses "playing dumb" strategically, you can provide additional real-life examples or quotes from different experts to elaborate on the idea.

Reformat and Structure:

Organize the script in a way that is fresh but still maintains the original flow. For instance, you might rearrange sections to emphasize different points, making it engaging for viewers while ensuring that it‚Äôs still around 8-10 minutes long.

Visual and Audio Additions:

Include visual aids, such as slides, animations, or footage that complements the points you're making. This can help you fill out the video length and add depth to the content.

Use background music, sound effects, or voice modulation to make the video feel more dynamic.

Add Your Insights:

Share your unique perspective on the ideas from the script. You can offer your own analysis or critique of the concepts, which not only helps to expand the content but also gives it a personal touch, making it distinct from the original.
